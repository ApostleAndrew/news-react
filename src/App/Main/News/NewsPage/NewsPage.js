    //                 The pound has bounced back on renewed hopes that Britain and the EU are on the verge of a Brexit deal.
	// 				Sterling rose by almost two cents against the US dollar on Tuesday to $1.30.3 as it was confirmed the cabinet was to meet on Wednesday to discuss the terms of a potential withdrawal agreement.
	// 				:: Ministers summoned to Downing St to see Brexit deal text
	// 				It was also up by more than half a cent against the euro to hit an eight-month high above â‚¬1.15.
	// 				However, gains were shaky as a string of Brexiteers and the DUP lined up to say the text was unlikely to be acceptable.
	// 				Labour said it would have to meet its six tests.
	// 				The UK currency was given a helping hand earlier in the day by official labour market data which showed wage growth reaching a new near-decade high over the summer.
	// 				It had tumbled close to $1.28 against the dollar on Monday after a weekend of political turbulence and reports that a number of ministers were on the verge of resigning over Theresa May's Brexit plans.
	// 				News of the looming cabinet meeting on the draft agreement emerged on Tuesday evening.
	// 				The pound has been gripped by volatility amid uncertainty about whether the UK will leave the EU next March without a trade deal in place.
	// 				Simon Harvey, market analyst at Monex Europe, cautioned that more work lay ahead even if agreement was reached between the UK government and Brussels.
	// 				"Should a deal be put on the table, sterling will likely rally up towards the $1.34 level. However, this rally may be short-lived as a key hurdle in the Brexit timeline remains - getting a deal through Parliament."
	// 				Experts including the Bank of England expect a sharp shock to the economy if there is a "no deal" withdrawal and the UK's independent fiscal watchdog has drawn comparisons with the impact of the three-day week in 1974. */}
